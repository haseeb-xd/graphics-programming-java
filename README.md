# Graphics Programming in Java 🎨💻

## A Tale of Two Brain Cells 🧠🧠

Hey there! 👋

Let me tell you a little story. Ever since I was a kid, I've always been *fascinated* by physics. But here's the kicker... I'm *terrible* at it. Yup, you heard that right. I’ve got two brain cells duking it out, and neither of them seems to know the difference between momentum and a moment of inspiration.

Now, I know what you're thinking: "How can someone who’s bad at physics be interested in graphics programming? Isn’t that like... physics with extra steps?" Well, you’re not wrong.

Oh, and did I mention my dad was a physics professor? Yeah, so basically, I’m the black sheep of the family when it comes to anything involving formulas, but hey, I’m good with code! 🐑

So, in the spirit of proving I can turn my love for physics (even if I'm bad at it) into something cool, I’ve decided to create this repo to track my **glorious** (and probably painful) journey in learning graphics programming in Java. The end goal? To create an awesome particle simulation and blow my last two brain cells in the process.

## Why You Should Care 🚀

Maybe you're like me—intrigued by physics but better at coding than calculating. Or maybe you just want to see a developer slowly lose his mind while trying to simulate particles. Either way, stick around for some fun!

### What’s in Here?

- **Java Graphics Programming Basics** 🎨
- **OpenGL and LWJGL Experiments** 💻
- **Physics Concepts (That I Don’t Understand) in Action** ⚛️
- **Occasional Memes** because life is too short to take it seriously.

So, if you're into graphics, physics, or watching someone struggle, this is the place for you.

Stay tuned for some cool (and occasionally disastrous) experiments. 💥

*Let’s see where this brain cell battle takes me!*
